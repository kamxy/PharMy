Our application uses an architecture based on additions to the Model, View, Controller (MVC) architecture. 

Models - Contains the object classes of the application
Screens - It is the view layer of the application. Each page has a view file in its own folder. 
Controllers - The app has not added service. It plays a role in transferring the data from the backend to the views. 
Components - It is the folder where the small view parts used in the pages are used in a dynamic way. 
Utils - Contains utility functions that can be used anywhere in the app Constants - It is the file where constant and unchangeable values are defined throughout the application. 
Theme - It is the file where you set the theme and values of the application. 
State Management - It ensures that every part of the application works interconnected and consistent. 
Google Cloud Platform - We used Google Maps Api and Google Direction Api for location and map infrastructure that form the basis of our application. Firebase - We used Firebase Firestore as database operations and Firebase Storage as assets storage. 
Lottie - we used lottie animation for splash screen 
As stage management, we used the Provider package.
